"text":"<p>I've come across a bunch of interesting German words starting with a \"K\" that are almost the same in English, except that in English that first \"k\" is mysteriously silent.</p><p>So you've got <strong>KNIE</strong>, which is knee, <strong>KNOTEN</strong>, which is knot, and <strong>KNETEN</strong>, which is to knead. The one I've picked out here is <strong>KNECHT</strong>, which is a knave, although strangely a knight in English is <strong>RITTER</strong>, or rider, in German.</p><p>Then there's <strong>KN&Ouml;CHEL</strong>, which is knuckle and also ankle. I'm sad to report that <strong>KNOBLAUCH</strong> is unfortunately not \"knob-leek\", but actually garlic. Though on second thoughts, garlic is a kind of stubby leek so maybe that is really the origin of the word after all. And perhaps <strong>KN&Ouml;DEL</strong>, which is dumpling, is really a kind of \"noodle\". But what about all those words like \"knackered\", \"knackers\" and \"knack\" -- do they have anything to do with <strong>KNACKWURST</strong> sausages? I wonder...</p>"
