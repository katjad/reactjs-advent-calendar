"text":"<p>For some weird reason, I really like this word. It has nothing to do with Turks, but is made up of two halves &ndash; <strong>T&Uuml;R</strong> meaning door and the other half meaning \"handle\". Hence door handle.</p><p>To me it just sounds right -- I think \"klinke\" is exactly the sort of clinking noise a door handle makes when you open it, particularly if it's actually a handle, not a knob, fnarr fnarr. Of course <strong>T&Uuml;R</strong> shouldn't be mixed up with <strong>TOR</strong>, which means \"gate\" as in the <strong>BRANDENBURGER TOR</strong> &ndash; the famous monument in central Berlin. You know, the one with the pillars and the horses on top.</p><p>When it comes to football, <strong>TOR</strong> is also a goal, which is why <strong>TORWART</strong> is a goal keeper. Germany's produced its fair share of top shot-stoppers in the past &ndash; from the kindly-looking Jens Lehmann who was at Arsenal for years to nasty Toni Schumacher who bulldozed that French striker in the 1982 World Cup semi-finals in Spain and never even got a yellow card. Not that I'm bitter or anything &ndash; it was, of course, Germany who got through at England's expense in the previous round, partly because former Hamburg striker Kevin Keegan couldn't find the back of the German <strong>TOR</strong>.</p>"
