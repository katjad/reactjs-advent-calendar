"text":"<p>Whoa, whoa, whoa stop right there. That is one helluva crazy word for \"speed limit\". Well <strong>BEGRENZUNG</strong> is \"limit\" and <strong>GESCHWINDIGKEIT</strong> \" is speed. Don't ask me why. But, hey, why use just 10 letters when 26 will do? Who wants three syllables when seven is even better?</p><p>Katja thinks <strong>GESCHWIND</strong> is kind of like \"swift\" in English. But she's only trying to be polite for what is a truly daft word. I mean you'd think you'd want something short and punchy if you were a copper booking a driver for going too fast.</p></p>No, we're not having this word. It's long, it's ugly, it's got too many nasty consonants. It's going in to Room 101. Goodbye <strong>GESCHWINDIGKEITSBEGRENZUNG</strong></p>"
