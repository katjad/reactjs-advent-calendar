"text":"<p>So I have absolutely no love of these creatures, whose point is beyond me. But no matter how vile they are, the name in German makes them sound kind of cute. Kind of. That's because <strong>NACKTSCHNECKE</strong> is literally a \"naked snail\", as opposed to an ordinary, <strong>SCHNECKE</strong>, which has a house on its back. I'm wondering, though, given they tend to show up at night, if they shouldn't really be called <strong>NACHTSCHNECKE</strong>.</p><p>Either way, they're still disgusting.</p>"
