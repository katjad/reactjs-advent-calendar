"text":"<p>I do quite like bunging some chicken thighs in the oven at 230C alongside some potatoes for a quick and easy roast dinner &ndash; something I learnt off Jamie Oliver I think. But I had always wondered why thigh in German was this ludicrously long word <strong>Oberschenkel</strong>. In fact, the meaning is clear when you realise that a <strong>Schenkel</strong> is basically the same word as \"shank\", as in a lamb shank, which is a juicy leg joint you have to slow cook. Nice with some flagellot beans by the way. <strong>Oberschenkel</strong> is therefore just \"upper shank\", which also explains why \"calf\" is <strong>Unterschenkel</strong>. But sorry, these words are just  silly. Can you imagine a footballer who's been crocked going \"Ooo mein Oberschenkel\"? No, nor me.</p>"
