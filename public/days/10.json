"text":"Right, this is a real stinker of a word. Useless. Rubbish. No idea what it meant when I first heard Katja use it the other day on the way to see \"Skyfall\". OK, I know that <strong>Wand</strong> means \"wall\" And <strong>auf</strong> sort of means \"on\" or \"up\". So \"upwall\" right? Wrong. Apparently it means \"effort\" or \"cost\", for some odd reason. Oh and before you try, don't even bother looking up its <a href=\"http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aufwand\">Wikipedia</a> entry, because it links to the even more eye-poppingly scary word <strong>Aufwandsentsch&auml;digung</strong>. No, don't ask me either."
