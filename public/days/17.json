"text":"<p>After yesterday's abomination of  <strong>GESCHWINDIGKEITSBEGRENZUNG</strong>, here's a great German word that's neat, simple and just doesn't have an equivalent in English. I'm talking about <strong>FEHLPASS</strong>, which is used in football to describe what happens when one player tries -- but fails -- to pass a ball to a team-mate. A \"failed pass\" if you like.</p><p>You hear it constantly on German telly from football commentators and pundits, although given the strength of German football, it's a term that's mainly directed at sloppy foreign players.</p><p>In fact, you have to like German if only for the fact that football is simply <strong>FUSSBALL</strong>. None of this weird \"futbol\" nonsense as in Spanish. A \"foot\"is a <strong>FUSS</strong>. A \"ball\" is a <strong>BALL</strong>. Football's a simple game and so is its translation into German.</p>"
