"text":"<p>I was just listening to my guilty pleasure &ndash; the Absolute Eighties digital-radio station after eating a plate of pasta &ndash; when what should come on but \"The Model\" by German electro-synth outfit Kraftwerk. Their name, which is usually totally mangled by English-speaking types, has two halves: Kraft and werk. Kraft for some reason means \"power\". And werk is kind of obvious &ndash; it's a works or, in this case, a station. So Kraftwerk is \"powerstation\", which &ndash; perhaps intentionally &ndash; was also the name of another 80s band that was formed as an offshoot from another synth group of the time: Duran Duran. I should add that Kraftwerk was one of the few internationally successful German groups during the early 80s, unless you count the criminally bad \"Goombay Dance Band\", which I don't because they are shit.<br /><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goombay_Dance_Band\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goombay_Dance_Band</a></p>"
