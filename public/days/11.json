"text":"<p>Cracking word, this one. It means \"to snore\".</p><p>I learned today from my brother-in-law's sister that in French \"to snore\" is \"ronfler\", which is a nice word but sounds just too polite. Schnarchen, on the other hand, gets the message across much better. I mean, you can't even say the word without wrinkling up your nose &ndash;, go on, try it. The only trouble is, tell someone \"you snore\" and it's <strong>DU SCHNARCHST</strong>, which is a bit tricky.</p>"
