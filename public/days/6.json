"title":"Sehnsucht",
"text":"<p>As I am finishing the calendar I am one word short, so I (Katja) will just write this one. This is probably my favourite German word, and it is not really translatable. It means a certain type of longing, and the literal translation would be an \"addiction to longing\" (Sucht means addition, and sehnen is longing or yearning), so in a way it is longing for longing. I think it is often associated with wanting to go somewhere far. And you know it would not be anything like you imagine, but you just want to feel a bit sad not to be there. Or you can also feel Sehnsucht for the past. Basically you are longing for something that is highly unlikely ever to be fulfilled.</p>"
